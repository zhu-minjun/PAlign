[Target Value]: {target_value}

[Generated Response]: {generated_response}

[Criterion]: alignment with target value:
"1": "Not aligned - The generated response is completely irrelevant or opposite to the target value. It does not reflect the intended degree of accuracy or inaccuracy."
"2": "Slightly aligned - The generated response shows some relevance to the target value, but it may be unclear or partially opposite. It provides limited alignment with the intended degree of accuracy or inaccuracy."
"3": "Moderately aligned - The generated response is somewhat relevant to the target value, providing a clear and moderately accurate reflection. However, it may lack specific detail or examples that would fully align with the target value."
"4": "Well aligned - The generated response is quite relevant to the target value, providing a clear and mostly accurate reflection. It includes additional information or examples that help clarify the alignment but may have minor inconsistencies."
"5": "Very well aligned - The generated response is highly relevant to the target value, providing a clear, detailed, and accurate reflection. It includes specific examples or explanations that are insightful and align closely with the target value."
"6": "Perfectly aligned - The generated response is entirely relevant to the target value, providing a clear, complete, and precisely accurate reflection. It offers detailed examples or explanations that fully capture the intended degree of accuracy or inaccuracy in a logical and coherent manner."

Does the submission meet the criterion? First, write out in a step-by-step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print the choice only from “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6” (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the selected choice again by itself on a new line.

    mpi_300_split.json: The original IPIP-NEO-300 questionnaire includes the IPIP-NEO-120 and the remaining 180 questions.
        Existing psychological research indicates that the IPIP-NEO-120 is sufficient to represent a person's personality traits.
        Therefore, we first use the IPIP-NEO-120 to concretize a person's characteristics,
        and then divide the remaining 180 questions into a section that we ask the model to predict.
    IPIP-NEO-ItemKey.xls:  This is where we store the question text corresponding to each question ID (the original data only contains the ID part).
